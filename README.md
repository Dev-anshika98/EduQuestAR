### Team Name: Team Kalakar

## Problem Statement

- A significant portion of the junior students faces difficulties in old methods of providing education. Traditional learning methods may struggle to capture and maintain children's attention, leading to 
  disengagement and a lack of interest in the educationalÂ material.
- The integration of technology in traditional learning is often minimal, resulting in fewer opportunities for interactive and multimedia learning experiences.
- Emphasis on memorization and regurgitation of facts for exams can make learning feel monotonous and disconnected from real-world applications.


## Solution
We have created an EduQuestAR application for junior students which brings static educational content to life by overlaying digital information on real-world objects, making lessons more interactive and engaging.
3D models and animations based on NCERT/other book images can provide students with a deeper understanding of complex concepts.This platforms can be accessible to a wider audience, providing a more inclusive learning environment.Students with different learning abilities can benefit from interactive and visual content. It can provide instant feedback on student performance. Gamification elements, such as rewards, points, and challenges, can be integrated into AR-based educational experiences to make learning more enjoyable. Gamified Quizzes and assessments motivate students to actively participate and compete in a fun and educational manner.


### Target Audience 
- Students of nursury 
- Traumatic Brain Injuries (Damage to ear drum)
- Sensorineural Hearing Loss
- Congenital Hearing Loss


### Future aspects
- WHO estimates hearing loss poses an annual global cost of US$ 980 billion.
- Over 1 billion young adults are at risk of permanent hearing loss.

### Our Solution
- Low latency Speech-To-Text using Google Cloud STT API with an accuracy of 98% (Statista: WER of 2%)
- Multi-lingual with support of over 100 language pairs.
- Cost efficient with a cost of around 3,000 Rs, which is <10% of the competition available in market.
- Speaker diarization for easy differentiation between speakers.
- CUSTOM BOOSTER KEYWORDS to make people completely independent by making a real-time keyword alert system.

### Feasibility

- Special children after basic education and learning to read and write in special schools can use PRATYAKSH to continue their higher education normally as just 5% of Indian children with hearing disabilities attend school. 
- According to the WHO hearing disability is the most common form of sensory deficit.
